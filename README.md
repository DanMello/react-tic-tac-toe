# About

This project was inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-aO5hzo1aw which is a live stream highlight with Dan Abramov and mpj (FunFunFunction on youtube). Dan mentioned that creating a tic tac toe app is a great way to learn the fundamentals of react and react hooks. At the end of the live stream he mentioned that it would be cool to see someone create a version of the tic tac toe game based on tutorial on the react website that uses hooks to separate different types of logic like game and history. So I did just that and I was learning a lot of new things and having fun so I just kept creating more features which now has become tic-tac-chat.

# What I learned

1. Learned how to use the React hooks including useState, useReducer and useEffect to make it easier to create more complex patterns, keep code more organized, and separate stateful logic that is unrelated.

2. Learned how to use WebSockets and how to handle the different events and update the state accordingly.
